Decode, a speech programming tool that aims to allow users to create a website entirely by using voice commands. With Decode, the user speaks natural voice commands which are interpreted and turned into HTML, CSS or JavaScript code. The user can preview the website they are making, ask for help, switch editors and turn off speech recognition, all by using voice commands.
